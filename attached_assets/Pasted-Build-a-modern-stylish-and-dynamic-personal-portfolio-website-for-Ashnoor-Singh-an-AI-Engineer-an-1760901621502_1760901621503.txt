Build a modern, stylish, and dynamic personal portfolio website for Ashnoor Singh, an AI Engineer and Data Scientist.

The design should have a cutting-edge AI aesthetic — sleek animations, glowing accents, gradients, and glassmorphism effects. Use a dark modern theme with highlights in electric blue and neon purple to represent AI and tech innovation. The layout should be clean, responsive, and professional with creative interactions.

The website should have the following sections:

🧠 1. Home / Hero Section

Headline: “Hi, I’m Ashnoor Singh — AI Engineer & Innovator.”

Subheadline: “Transforming ideas into intelligent solutions with Machine Learning, NLP, and Generative AI.”

Add a “View Projects” button and a dynamic AI-themed animation (like neural networks or particles moving).

Include a minimalist professional photo placeholder.
